### questions and answers

photos, pixels, text = unstructured data
m = number os trining examples

### supervised learning with neural network:

Applications and types of neural networks:

|input features|exprected output|type of NN|
|-|-|-|
|home features|price|standart NN|
|ad user info|click on the ad?|standart NN|
|image|indentify objects|CNN|
|audio||1d RNN|
|language||comples RNN|

### why is deep learning taking off?

The primary reason is the amount of data we have been accumulating in recent times. Today deep leaning models can improve a lot better than common algorithms due to its capability of deal with large ammount of data and understand great patters with it, which doens't necessaraly occour in common algorithms, such as SVM, KNN.

In general old algorithm models deal better with small datasets where deep learning models can deal greatly with large datasets.

### Loss function and Cost Function

* LOSS: measures how good the **predicted values** are in compairson with the **real values** in a single example
* COST: measures how good the parameters are going within the training set. It is the average of all loss measurements.
